\section{\texorpdfstring{Introduction
\label{Introduction}}{Introduction }}\label{introduction}}

How do we compare living standards and economic productivity between
countries? This is one of the questions that macroeconomics attempts to
answers and a number of tools have been developed within the field to
this end. One of these tools is the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
theory, which uses a basket of goods to compare the currencies of
different countries. This theory has been widely tested using data, and
the results have been divisive and somewhat puzzling.@puz.

In this essay, I replicate\footnote{More accurately, try my best to
  replicate} the paper ``Real Exchange Rate Behaviour: Evidence from
Black Markets'' by \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kul}{Luintel}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kul}{2000}), which tests the PPP hypothesis. I
include some other tests in addition to those in the paper as a
robustness check on the results.

This essay\footnote{This essay was written in R using the package by
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-Texevier}{Katzke}
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Texevier}{2017})} is organised as follows.
Section \ref{Context} contextualises Luintel's paper and discusses the
robustness checks. Section \ref{Data} discusses the data and reports the
results of the Wald-Wolfowitz tests. Section \ref{Unit} deals with the
unit root tests. Section \ref{Var} reports the results of the variance
ratio test and section \ref{Struc} presents the structural break tests.

\hypertarget{context-and-evaluation}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Context and Evaluation
\label{Context}}{Context and Evaluation }}\label{context-and-evaluation}}

provide a brief section that outlines the context and questions of the
replicated study: The first part should outline what the authors do, how
they motivate the question as of economic interest and/or importance,
how they motivate their methods and how they argue that their
contribution is novel

The second part can be a critical evaluation of their approach and
choices which leads to your choices of robustness checks/extensions

Over the past decade, the purchasing-power parity (PPP) puzzle has taken
two forms. Its early form arose from early tests of unit roots in real
exchange rates, which failed to reject the null hypothesis, thus casting
doubts on the long-term PPP hypothesis of real exchange rates' mean
reversion. Following the development of more powerful tests that
resulted in rejections of unit roots, the PPP-puzzle re-surfaced in the
form of surprisingly slow rates of convergence of real exchange rates to
their long-run means. Rogoff (1996) expressed this puzzle in terms of
the estimated ``half-life'' of real exchange rate shocks being 3 to 5
years. Recent research has attempted to solve that second form of the
puzzle by adopting non-linear stochastic models of real exchange rates.
Despite this introduction of non-linearities, the literature has
continued to focus on the notion of ``half-life'' as a measure of
persistence.

The theory of purchasing power parity (PPP) is one of the most widely
tested economics. The overall findings can be summarized as follows.
Studies based data wholly reject PPP.1 Rogoff (1996, p.~644) calls this
set of evidence `the abject law of one price. Time-series studies based
on aggregate price indices for also largely reject PPP and suggest that
the real exchange rate behaves as random walk hypothesis implies that
shocks to the real exchange rate are persistent is no tendency for PPP
to hold in the short run or in the long run. Rogoff summarizes this set
of findings as 'something of an embarrassment' to the argues that every
`reasonable' theoretical model suggests a mean reverting real the long
run.3

The behaviour of real exchange rates (relative to the US dollar) is
examined using monthly from the black markets for foreign exchange of
eight Asian developing countries. The data The black market real
exchange rates do not show excess volatility during the recent float
contrast to the results reported elsewhere. Unit root tests in
heterogeneous panels and variance confirm their stationarity. Thus, we
find support for PPP but not for the `survivorship' Rogoff, 1995). There
is little evidence of segmented trends. Issues raised by Rogoff (1996)
would hold across countries with differing growth experience-and Lothian
and Taylor whether the degree of relative price volatility may bias
results in favour of mean reverting rates -are addressed. Copyright ©

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Data \label{Data}}{Data }}\label{data}}

The data used for the analysis is a series on black market nominal
exchange rates and consumer price indices (CPI) for 8 developing Asian
countries, namely: India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Malaysia, Pakistan,
Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand. I take a subset of these countries by
excluding Taiwan\footnote{I excluded Taiwan because there is some data
  missing from the set and I don't know how to adjust an unbalanced
  panel. However, it is also interesting to test if the results hold
  when taking a subset} from the analysis.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kul}{Luintel} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kul}{2000})
sources data from various issues of \emph{Pick's Currency Year Book} and
\emph{World Currency Year Book}. The data used for Luintel's paper is
accessible through the Journal of Applied Econometrics archive, which is
where I attained my data. The sample period runs for 31 periods from
January 1958 to June 1989. This sample period is split into two parts:
Bretton Woods and after Bretton Woods (also referred to as pre-float
period and the float period).

The nominal exchange rates are units currencies per unit of US dollar.
There were two mistakes in the nominal exchange rate datasets: for
Myanmar November 1974, there was a value of 1.45, which I replaced with
16.5 (based on interpolation). And for the Philippines in September
1975, there was a value of 0.7 with which I replaced with 7.7 (based on
interpolation).\footnote{I discovered these mistakes when there was a
  dramatic difference in my plots of the real exchange rates and
  Luintel's plots.} Luintel sources the CPI figures from issues of
International Financial Statistics (which are included in Luintel's
dataset available in the JAE data archives).

To calculate the real exchange rates, I follow the lead of
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kul}{Luintel} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kul}{2000})
and apply the following formula to the nominal exchange rates:

\[
rex = log(Nominal Exchange Rate) - log(CPI) + log(United States CPI)
\]

I plot the real exchange rate series below in \ref{Figure1}. The plots
below match those of \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kul}{Luintel}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kul}{2000: 166}) and indicate that the real
exchange rates are trending. Additionally, the graphs show that the
black market exchange rates are somewhat volatile. As expected, we see
that after the first oil shock of 1973 the currencies appreciated and
then slowly reverted. The plots suggest that the trends are segmented. I
test this hypothesis using formal tests, reported below the plots in

1980s. TDollar is the only currency which appreciated against the sample
period; the rest depreciated over time. Peso shows a blip (sharp
devaluation) These plots indicate segmented trends. However, formal
tests (reported below) structural breaks than there appear visually.
Another interesting aspect of these are no discernible patterns of
volatility between pre- and

To make your graphs look extra nice in latex world, you could use Tikz
device. Replace dev - `png' with `tikz' in the chunk below. Notice this
makes the build time longer and produces extra tex files - so if you are
comfortable with this, set your device to Tikz and try it out:

To reference the plot above, add a ``\textbackslash label'\,' after the
caption in the chunk heading, as done above. Then reference the plot as
such: As can be seen, Figures \ref{Figure1} and \ref{Figure2} are
excellent, with Figure \ref{Figure2} being particularly aesthetically
pleasing due to its device setting of Tikz. The nice thing now is that
it correctly numbers all your figures (and sections or tables) and will
update if it moves. The links are also dynamic.

I very strongly suggest using ggplot2 (ideally in combination with
dplyr) using the ggtheme package to change the themes of your figures.

Also note the information that I have placed above the chunks in the
code chunks for the figures. You can edit any of these easily - visit
the Rmarkdown webpage for more information.

\section{Splitting a page}\label{splitting-a-page}}

You can also very easily split a page using built-in Pandoc formatting.
I comment this out in the code (as this has caused issues building the
pdf for some users - which I presume to be a Pandoc issue), but you are
welcome to try it out yourself by commenting out the following section
in your Rmd file.

Equations should be written as such:

\begin{align}
\beta = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_{t-1}^2} \label{eq1} \\
\int_{x = 1}^{\infty}x_{i} = 1 \notag
\end{align}

If you would like to see the equations as you type in Rmarkdown, use \$
symbols instead (see this for yourself by adjusted the equation):

\[
\beta = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_{t-1}^2} \\
\int_{x = 1}^{\infty}x_{i} = 1
\]

Note again the reference to equation \ref{eq1}. Writing nice math
requires practice. Note I used a forward slashes to make a space in the
equations. I can also align equations using \textbf{\&}, and set to
numbering only the first line. Now I will have to type ``begin
equation'\,' which is a native \LaTeX command. Here follows a more
complicated equation:

\begin{align}
    y_t &= c + B(L) y_{t-1} + e_t   \label{eq2}    \\ \notag
    e_t &= H_t^{1/2}  z_t ; \quad z_t \sim  N(0,I_N) \quad \& \quad H_t = D_tR_tD_t \\ \notag
        D_t^2 &= {\sigma_{1,t}, \dots, \sigma_{N,t}}   \\ \notag
        \sigma_{i,t}^2 &= \gamma_i+\kappa_{i,t}  v_{i, t-1}^2 +\eta_i  \sigma_{i, t-1}^2, \quad \forall i \\ \notag
        R_{t, i, j} &= {diag(Q_{t, i, j}}^{-1}) . Q_{t, i, j} . diag(Q_{t, i, j}^{-1})  \\ \notag
        Q_{t, i, j} &= (1-\alpha-\beta)  \bar{Q} + \alpha  z_t  z_t'  + \beta  Q_{t, i, j} \notag
\end{align}

Note that in \ref{eq2} I have aligned the equations by the equal signs.
I also want only one tag, and I create spaces using ``quads'\,'.

See if you can figure out how to do complex math using the two examples
provided in \ref{eq1} and \ref{eq2}.

Tables can be included as follows. Use the \emph{xtable} (or kable)
package for tables. Table placement = H implies Latex tries to place the
table Here, and not on a new page (there are, however, very many ways to
skin this cat. Luckily there are many forums online!).

Including tables that span across pages, use the following (note that I
add below the table: ``continue on the next page'\,'). This is a neat
way of splitting your table across a page.

Use the following default settings to build your own possibly long

cleanly spreads over multiple pages:

\subsection{Huxtable}\label{huxtable}}

Huxtable is a very nice package for making working with tables between
Rmarkdown and Tex easier.

This cost some adjustment to the Tex templates to make it work, but it
now works nicely.

See documentation for this package
\href{https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/huxtable.html}{here}. A
particularly nice addition of this package is for making the printing of
regression results a joy (see
\href{https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/huxtable.html\#creating-a-regression-table}{here}).
Here follows an example:

If you are eager to use huxtable, comment out the Huxtable table in the
Rmd template, and uncomment the colortbl package in your Rmd's root.

Note that I do not include this in the ordinary template, as some latex
users have complained it breaks when they build their Rmds (especially
those using tidytex - I don't have this problem as I have the full
Miktex installed on mine). Up to you, but I strongly recommend
installing the package manually and using huxtable. To make this work,
uncomment the \emph{Adding additional latex packages} part in yaml at
the top of the Rmd file. Then comment out the huxtable example in the
template below this line. Reknit, and enjoy.

FYI - R also recently introduced the gt package, which is worthwhile

To add lists, simply using the following notation

\begin{itemize}
\item
  This is really simple

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Just note the spaces here - writing in R you have to sometimes be
    pedantic about spaces\ldots{}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Note that Rmarkdown notation removes the pain of defining
  \LaTeX environments!
